Form 860 folder contains annual electric generator capacity data - in-service date, prime movers, generating capacity, energy sources, existing and proposed generators, county and state location, ownership, and FERC qualifying facility status. Monthly data is also available from the website, but I didn't download it. (2001-2016)

Form 923 folder contains monthly power plant operating data, including predecessor forms 920 and 906 - electricity generation, fuel consumption, useful thermal output, fossil fuel stocks, fuel deliveries, quantity delivered, supplier, coal mine type, Btu, sulfur, and ash content, and receipts at the power plant and prime mover level. (2001-2016)

Cooling data was only available for a few years (2014-2016)

2017 data should be available from forms 860 and 923 sometime soon (maybe by the end of this month...)
