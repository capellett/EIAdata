Files downloaded from https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/detail-data.html

Form 860 folder contains annual electric generator capacity data - in-service date, prime movers, generating capacity, energy sources, existing and proposed generators, county and state location, ownership, and FERC qualifying facility status. Monthly data is also available from the website, but I didn't download it. (2001-2016)

Form 923 folder contains monthly power plant operating data, including predecessor forms 920 and 906 - electricity generation, fuel consumption, useful thermal output, fossil fuel stocks, fuel deliveries, quantity delivered, supplier, coal mine type, Btu, sulfur, and ash content, and receipts at the power plant and prime mover level. (2001-2016)

Cooling data was only available for a few years (2014-2016) https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/water/

2017 data should be available from forms 860 and 923 sometime soon (maybe by the end of this month...)

It looks like I updated 2017 and 2018 data back in April 6, 2020 (860, 923, and cooling detail). Today I've downloaded 2019 and 2020 data for forms 860, 923, and cooling detail.

Dr. Laljeet Sangha downloaded updates for 2022, and I've now downloaded most of the tables for 2023. Cooling detail is supposed to be released in November 2024.
