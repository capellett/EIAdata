A data frame with 45 variables:
\describe{
\item{\code{Utility ID}, \code{Utility Name}}{Unique identification codes and names of the electricity utilities.}
\item{\code{Plant Code}, \code{Plant Name}}{EIA-assigned plant code}
\item{\code{County}},
\item{\code{Latitude}, \code{Longitude}}{Physical location of each plant, including address and geographic coordinates.}
\item{\code{NERC Region}}{North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)region in which the plant operates}
\item{\code{Balancing Authority Code}}{A 5-character code for the balancing authority managing supply, demand, and interchanges within an electrically defined area. May or may not be the same as the Owner of Transmission/Distribution Facilities.}
\item{\code{Balancing Authority Name}}{Name of Balancing Authority}
\item{\code{Name of Water Source}}{The name of the principal source from which cooling water or water for generating power for hydroelectric plants is obtained. If #'water is from an underground aquifer, provide name of aquifer, if known. If name of 'aquifer is not known,  “Wells.”  “Municipality” if the water is from a municipality.  “UNK” for planned facilities for which the water source is not known.  “NA” for
plants that do not use a water source for cooling or hydroelectric generation.}
\item{\code{Primary Purpose (NAICS Code)}}{North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 'that best describes the primary purpose of the plant.Electric utility plants and
independent power producers whose primary purpose is generating electricity for sale will generally use code 22. For generators whose primary business is an industrial or
commercial process (e.g., paper mills, refineries, chemical plants, etc.) and for which generating electricity is a secondary purpose, use a code other than 22.}
\item{\code{Regulatory Status}}{Indicates whether the plant is regulated (RE) or non-regulated (NR) }
\item{\code{Sector}}{Plant-level sector name, designated by the primary purpose, regulatory status and plant-level combined heat and power status.Options include Commercial, Electric Utility, Industrial, Non-CHP Independent Power Producer (IPP), CHP IPP.}
\item{\code{Sector Name}}{Plant-level sector number, designated by the primary purpose, regulatory status and plant-level combined heat and power status, "1 = Electric Utility , 2 = Independent Power Producer, Non-Combined Heat and Power, 3 = Independent Power Producer, Combined Heat and Power, 4 = Commercial, Non-Combined Heat and Power,
5 = Commercial, Combined Heat and Power, 6 = Industrial, Non-Combined Heat and Power, 7 = Industrial, Combined Heat and Power" }
